# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a minimal repository called "mlb-qbench" with only basic documentation files. The repository currently contains:
- A basic README.md with just the project name
- An MIT License file
- No source code, configuration files, or development tooling

## Current State

This appears to be a newly initialized repository with no actual code implementation yet. There are no:
- Package configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- Source code directories
- Build scripts or development tools
- Testing frameworks
- Linting configurations

## Development Notes

Since this is an empty repository, any future development will need to establish:
- Project structure and source code organization
- Build and development tooling
- Testing framework setup
- Code quality tools (linting, formatting)
- Dependency management

When code is added to this repository, this CLAUDE.md file should be updated to reflect the actual project architecture, build commands, and development workflows.
