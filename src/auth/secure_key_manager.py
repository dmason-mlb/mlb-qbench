"""Secure API key management with cryptographic hashed storage.

This module provides enterprise-grade API key management with cryptographic security.
Keys are stored as PBKDF2 hashes with unique salts, preventing exposure even if
memory is compromised. The system supports multiple key types with metadata tracking.

Security Features:
    - PBKDF2-SHA256 key hashing with 100,000 iterations
    - Unique salt generation for each key (32 bytes)
    - Timing-safe comparison to prevent timing attacks
    - Automatic plaintext key cleanup from memory
    - Activity status tracking for key lifecycle management
    - Usage statistics for monitoring and auditing

Key Types:
    - Master keys: Full administrative access
    - User keys: Standard user access with restrictions
    - Service keys: Service-to-service authentication

Environment Variables:
    - MASTER_API_KEY: Single master key for admin operations
    - USER_API_KEY_1, USER_API_KEY_2, etc.: Numbered user keys
    - USER_API_KEY_N_DESC: Optional descriptions for user keys
    - SERVICE_API_KEY_<NAME>: Named service keys

Dependencies:
    - hashlib: For PBKDF2 cryptographic hashing
    - hmac: For timing-safe hash comparison
    - secrets: For cryptographically secure salt generation
    - structlog: For security event logging
    - pydantic: For type-safe metadata models

Used by:
    - src.auth.auth: For API key authentication
    - src.service.main: For protecting API endpoints
    - Administrative tools: For key management operations

Complexity:
    - Key verification: O(n*k) where n=number of keys, k=hash iterations (100,000)
    - Hash generation: O(k) where k=hash iterations
    - Metadata operations: O(1) dictionary lookups
